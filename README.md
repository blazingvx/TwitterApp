# Social Media Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
The popularity of social media platforms has witnessed significant growth with the advent of faster internet networks and the availability of cheaper digital devices, particularly smartphones. This increased usage of social media, including micro-blogging platforms like Twitter, has led people to express their views instantly on these platforms. Both political parties and citizens are keen to understand the sentiments of the masses. 

The goal of this project is to develop an understanding of sentiment analysis concerning public opinion and politicians on social media platforms and present it in an easily understandable manner. Additionally, the project aims to perform comparative analysis and studies among different national parties to identify the highlighted topics, key individuals, or campaigns that define a party at any given time in terms of different sentiments. These insights are collected at a country-wide level, specifically focusing on India, and can also be used to understand sentiments at the macro-regional level, such as states and union territories. The sentiment analysis results are displayed on a dashboard to provide a comprehensive view of the Indian political system, assisting citizens in making informed decisions for the betterment of society.
